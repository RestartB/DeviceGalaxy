        DeviceGalaxy is hosted in the United Kingdom. By using DeviceGalaxy, you agree to UK laws
        and guidelines, as well as the guidelines of your own country, and the ones in the terms of

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2.5" id="data">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Basic Data</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit DeviceGalaxy, I may collect basic information like IP addresses and some
        information about your device. This is required for the website to function.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2.5" id="database">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Database and Password Security</h2>
      <p>
        The database that DeviceGalaxy uses to store data is stored securely and is only accessible
        by me. Passwords are hashed and salted to ensure that in the unlikely case of an
        unauthorised party accessing the database, they will not be able to retrieve the original
        passwords.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2.5" id="devices">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Device Security</h2>
      <p>
        When you add a device to DeviceGalaxy, the device can only be accessed by you unless you
        create a share link. When you create a share link, users will be able to access the device
        (or all of your devices if you generated an account share link) using the generated link.
        When the device is shared, all metadata about the device will be public, but the public will
        not be able to edit the device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2.5" id="images">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Image Security</h2>
      <p>
        When you upload an image to a device on DeviceGalaxy, you will be the only one that can
        access it, unless you share the device or your account. DeviceGalaxy will also strip all
        EXIF data from all uploaded images automatically, including location information, to ensure
        that you stay private. This protection can not be disabled. <strong
          >Please note that profile pictures are public and can be accessed by anyone, including
          users without an account.</strong

        Please note that the website uses the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree"
